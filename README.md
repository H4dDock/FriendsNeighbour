# FriendsNeighbour
***It's not a product, just a project***

The acute problem of the 21st century is poor socialization. Do you know at least 3 of your neighbors in person?I don't think so.

Large social networks don't solve this problem. The FriendsNeighbor service should bring people who lives in one district closer.
